# Nested Squarified Treemap
I realize the squarified treemap of both nested and non-nested form  based on [Mark Bruls paper](https://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/stm.pdf) 

You can find this from the dictionary named  `treemap_algorithm` .

Besides, I accomplish few interactions of treemap based on `d3` to layout Chinese Provinces. Try it in the dictionary named  `treemap_interaction` .
